# Member-Registration-System

This is a simple project written in C++ on Visual Studio.

It is a desktop application with a front-end and a Microsoft SQL database as backend. 

While the user can create data on the registration page, the login page also provides a verification function of checking if the data input matches the existing member data in the Microsoft SQL database.

You can reset the Microsoft SQL server to connect to your own server on Visual Studio.
